            A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth. It
            is believed it takes about 80 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the
            corner of the eyes, an action knowns as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles performed without the eye contraction
            may be perceived as insincere.
